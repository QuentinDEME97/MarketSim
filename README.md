# Welcome

Hi ! This repository is one of my never-ended projects. I used Primer's Youtube Channel work as a starting point.

For now there's not a lot of work but this is what i'd like to do.

# The concept

The goal is to simulate multiple markets:

- Country level market
- International market

Thanks to Primer's work, i already have a mechanic to adjust the price in function of the demand, reach an equilibrium, etc. What i'd like is now to apply this methods to different kind of stuff. First, citizens (The buyers) will have to buy certain things like Food, Wood, etc.
